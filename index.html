            Before I swtiched to Computer Science, I was a Mechanical
            Engineering Major. But once I needed to start programming Arduinos
            for various projects, I quickly fell in love with programming. So
            much that I switched my major to Computer Science.

        <h2>FIU COVID-19 App Prototype – Spring 2021</h2>
        <p>
          During the 2021 spring semester, I was assigned to lead a team of 12
          people to develop a COVID-19 app using Flutter throughout a 9 week
          development period. Despite having almost no experience in Flutter (or
          any type of mobile development experience), we managed to create a
          working prototype.
          <br /><br />
          The app we created was an app that served two purposes. The first one
          being to help students complete a safety check before they came on
          campus. The second purpose was to let people know if they were exposed
          to COVID-19 while on school grounds–unfortunately, we were not able to
          implement the bluetooth protocols during the development period. We
          used Firebase for our backend, Flutter as the framework to develop our
          app for both platforms of phones, and Figma to design the user
          interface.

        <h2>The Social Distancing Graduation Cap – Spring 2020</h2>
        <p>
          Due to COVID-19, everyone’ morale was low. I saw an opportunity to
          make other laugh and enjoy themselves while riding out the pandemic. I
          wanted to make something so goofy that related to the situation we
          were in. Therefore, I decided to get creative with my graduation cap.
          What I did was that I attached an ultrasonic sensor, and Arduino, and
          a beeper on my graduation cap.
          <br /><br />
          What the graduation cap did was that the ultrasonic sensor feeds
          distance readings into the Arduino. The Arduino processes the data
          from the sensor and performs calculations that controls the timing of
          the beeper. The end result was a graduation cap that starts beeping
          when it detects something is 6ft or closer–then beeps faster if the
          object does get closer.
