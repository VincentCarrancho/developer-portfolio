# This is my Developer Portfolio!
My name is Vincent and this is my portfolio repository!

## Introduction
As of July 27 2021, this page was just made with vanilla Javascript, HTML, and CSS. Although I am thinking about migrating this to either a React.js app or a Next.js app. Either way, this is a learning experience for me.

## Layout

This is the basic layout I designed in Figma. I went for a minimal design look, although the color of the background is subject to change. Otherwise, it's all good!
